# BlenderVK
This project is a pet project of mine designed to make a modern OpenSource 3D animation program with Vulkan. First things first however,
what does this project aim to do, and what does is not aim to do.

This project aims to modernize 3D animation programs as a whole, don't let the name fool you, this is not Blender and the name BlenderVK
is just a temporary codename. This program will feature visual scripting for various tasks and plugins, a deferred Vulkan realtime rendrer
with PBR, and various other nice features. It will be coded entirely in C++ and use the C++ Core guidelines to help boost it further.
